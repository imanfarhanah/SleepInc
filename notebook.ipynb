    "Your client, SleepInc, has shared anonymized sleep data from their hot new sleep tracking app SleepScope. As their data science consultant, your mission is to analyze the lifestyle survey data with Python to discover relationships between exercise, gender, occupation, and sleep quality. See if you can identify patterns leading to insights on sleep quality.\n",
